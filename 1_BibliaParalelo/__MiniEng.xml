						And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
					</seg>
					<seg id="b.GEN.1.7" type="verse">
						And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.

						And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
					</seg>
					<seg id="b.GEN.1.11" type="verse">
						And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.
					</seg>
					<seg id="b.GEN.1.12" type="verse">
						And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

						And the evening and the morning were the third day.
					</seg>
					<seg id="b.GEN.1.14" type="verse">
						And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:

						And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.

					<seg id="b.GEN.1.16" type="verse">
						And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
					</seg>
					<seg id="b.GEN.1.17" type="verse">
						And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,
					</seg>

						And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
					</seg>
					<seg id="b.GEN.1.20" type="verse">
						And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
					</seg>
					<seg id="b.GEN.1.21" type="verse">
						And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.
					</seg>
					<seg id="b.GEN.1.22" type="verse">
						And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.

						And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
					</seg>

					</seg>
					<seg id="b.GEN.1.25" type="verse">
						And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

						And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
					</seg>
					<seg id="b.GEN.1.27" type="verse">

						And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.
					</seg>
					<seg id="b.GEN.2.6" type="verse">
						But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
					</seg>

						And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
					</seg>
					<seg id="b.GEN.2.9" type="verse">
						And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
					</seg>
					<seg id="b.GEN.2.10" type="verse">
						And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.
					</seg>
					<seg id="b.GEN.2.11" type="verse">
						The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;

					<seg id="b.GEN.2.12" type="verse">
						And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
					</seg>
					<seg id="b.GEN.2.13" type="verse">
						And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.
					</seg>
					<seg id="b.GEN.2.14" type="verse">
						And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.

						And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.

						And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.

						And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.

					<seg id="b.GEN.2.21" type="verse">
						And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;

					<seg id="b.GEN.2.22" type="verse">
						And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.

						And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:

						And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.
					</seg>
					<seg id="b.GEN.3.7" type="verse">
						And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.

					<seg id="b.GEN.3.8" type="verse">
						And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.

					<seg id="b.GEN.3.9" type="verse">
						And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?

						And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.

						And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?

						And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.

						And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.

					<seg id="b.GEN.3.14" type="verse">
						And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:

					<seg id="b.GEN.3.15" type="verse">
						And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.

					<seg id="b.GEN.3.16" type="verse">
						Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
					</seg>
					<seg id="b.GEN.3.17" type="verse">
						And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;

						And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.
